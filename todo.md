Build a page that:

Tells a story. This can be personal, or not. Funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but generally, it should be something in the range of
* 3-10 paragraphs or sections
  * Create a resume page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
  * Tell the story of a trip that you took.
  * Talk about some hobby or passion of yours.

Tech stuff:
* [ ] Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>
* [ ] Use at least one <img> tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
* [ ] Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use Â©, but you should also try to get creative here.
* [ ] Gets creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!
