## Assignment 1 - HTML me something
### Tools stuff:
* [x] make it a git repository
* [x] commit your work (feature by feature)
* [x] create Github repository => https://github.com/static-neex/html-me-something
* [x] push to GitHub
* [x] submit to Canvas
* [x] show to a TF
* [x] activate Github Pages => http://static.neex.io/html-me-something

### Requirements:
#### HTML
* [x] create index.html with
  * [x] `<html>`
  * [x] `<head>`
  * [x] `<title>`
  * [x] `<body>`
* Build a page that:
  * Tells a story. This can be personal, or not. Funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but generally, it should be something in the range of
    * [x] 3-10 paragraphs or sections
  * [x] Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags:
    * [x] `<p>`
    * [x] `<header>`
    * [x] `<footer>`
    * [x] `<main>`
    * [x] `<article>`
    * [x] Uses at least one `<img>` tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new sub-folder called images within your html-me-something directory.
    * [x] Uses at least one HTML entity.
  * [x] Is creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great.
  * [x] Do not add CSS yet.  
  * [x] You're free to use tags that haven't been explicitly introduced in class
* [x] Pass w3 validator

#### CSS
* [x] Create a file named styles.css in your html-me-something/ directory
* [x] OPTIONAL - Add a normalization stylesheet.
* [x] specific requirements
  * [x] margin
  * [x] padding
  * [x] element
  * [x] class
  * [x] id
* [x] Don't break these rules:
  * At all costs, avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect.
  * Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary.
* [x] add something from yourself.

### TODOs:
* [x] re-scale images to max width (retina?)
* [x] resize images to fit sections
* [x] optimize images (gulp installed)
* [x] menu shadow on hover
* [x] menu whole area click
* [ ] TODO: make screenshots
* [x] minify files
* [x] research usage of img inside h1 - allowed, and even used by w3 themselves :)
* [ ] TODO: move todo outside of README, and create normal README
* [ ] TODO: gulp screenshots
* [ ] TODO: add no follow/ ignore me/ whatever it is - for search engines
* [ ] Google's optimization looks terrible. Revert, but make images smaller. Seems like 800x600 is a bit excessive. Add info on responsive images.
